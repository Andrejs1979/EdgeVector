### ðŸ”’ Restricts

- No new issues can be opened
- No new pull requests can be created

- Star/watch still work

### ðŸ“¢ Communicates

- Clear "Archived" badge on repository

## Alternative: Add Topic Tags

If you prefer not to archive immediately, you can add these GitHub topics to signal the repository status:

1. Go to repository homepage
2. Click on the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics:
   - `archived`
   - `historical`
   - `mvp`
   - `superseded`
   - `learning-resource`

This makes the status clear without making it read-only.

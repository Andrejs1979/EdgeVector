# EdgeVector Repository Archive Notice

**Archive Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** Archived - No longer actively maintained
**Successor Repository:** https://github.com/FinHub-vc/NoSQL

## Why This Repository Was Archived

This EdgeVector repository was an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation created during Phase 1 development. After comprehensive analysis, it was determined that the **NoSQL repository** (https://github.com/FinHub-vc/NoSQL) is the canonical, production-ready version of EdgeVector DB.

### Key Reasons for Consolidation

1. **Production Deployment** - NoSQL is deployed to production with active users
2. **Feature Completeness** - NoSQL has 13x more code and 27x more features
3. **Active Maintenance** - NoSQL receives regular updates and improvements
4. **Enterprise Features** - NoSQL includes advanced capabilities not in this MVP
5. **Official Repository** - NoSQL is under the FinHub organization

## For Users of This Repository

### If You're Using This MVP Code

**Action Required:** Migrate to the production NoSQL repository.

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Install Production SDK:**
   ```bash
   npm install edgevector
   ```

2. **Update Your Code:**
   The NoSQL repository maintains API compatibility while adding more features.

3. **Review Documentation:**
   Visit the NoSQL repository for up-to-date documentation and examples.

4. **Get Support:**
   All support and development happens in the NoSQL repository.

### If You're Learning from This Code

This repository remains valuable as a **learning resource** for:

- Understanding MVP development approach
- Seeing clean, simple implementations
- Learning GraphQL API design
- Studying vector search fundamentals

The codebase is simpler and easier to understand than the full production system.

## Migration Guide

### From EdgeVector MVP to NoSQL Production

**Quick Migration:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (EdgeVector MVP)
import { EdgeVectorClient } from './sdk'

const client = new EdgeVectorClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8787'
})

// AFTER (NoSQL Production)
import { quickStart } from 'edgevector'

const client = quickStart(
  process.env.EDGEVECTOR_API_KEY,
  'my-app'
)
```

**All core APIs remain compatible** - your existing code should work with minimal changes.

### Features You'll Gain

By migrating to NoSQL, you immediately gain:

- âœ… **Production Infrastructure** - Deployed and battle-tested
- âœ… **Global Edge Distribution** - Sub-10ms latency worldwide
- âœ… **Enhanced Vector Search** - HNSW and IVF indexing
- âœ… **Time Series Analytics** - High-frequency data ingestion
- âœ… **Offline-First Operations** - Works without internet
- âœ… **Multi-Cloud Failover** - 99.99% uptime guarantee
- âœ… **ORM Compatibility** - Use your existing database code
- âœ… **Enterprise Monitoring** - Full observability stack
- âœ… **Active Support** - Regular updates and improvements
